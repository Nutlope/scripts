# Random scripts I use

If on mac/linux, use `chmod +x ./$SCRIPTNAME` to make the script executable before running.

Run the script by simply typing ./$SCRIPTNAME if it's in your current folder.

## Scripts

So far here are the scripts I have:

1. CRA-cleanup-JS.sh: Cleans up a new create-react-app instance since I delete the same exact files and lines of code each time
2. CRA-cleanup-TS.sh: Same as #1 but for a new create-react-app typescript instance
3. gitcommit.sh: Combine git add, git commit, and git push into one command to save keystrokes
