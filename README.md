# Dev Scripts

> Scripts I use to enhance my productivity as a dev.

## Usage

1. Git clone the repo or copy the script you want into a local .sh file
2. Run `chmod +x ./$SCRIPTNAME` to make the script executable before executing the script.
3. Run the script by simply typing `./$SCRIPTNAME` if it's in your current folder.

## Scripts

So far here are the scripts I have:

1. **CRA-cleanup-JS.sh**: Cleans up a new create-react-app instance since I delete the same exact files and lines of code each time
2. **CRA-cleanup-TS.sh**: Same as #1 but for a new create-react-app typescript instance
3. **gitcommit.sh**: Combine git add, git commit, and git push into one command to save keystrokes
